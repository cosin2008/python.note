# python.note

The **[python.note]( https://cosin2008.github.io/python.note/)** is a collection of learning notes on how to ramp up with modern technique blocks on Python stack.

Actually, [Awesome-Python](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python) is a great collection for all kinds of python blocks. And it is really hard to balance quality and ammount while deciding if to pick up a block into collection. So, as it should be, not all of these blocks are really awesome in good taste and up-to-date. Developers have to investigate deeply with a blind jump into those common issues of these blocks to make a choice. This is not awesome as well.

In **[python.note]( https://cosin2008.github.io/python.note/)**, we will try get things done in different way. We will recommend the most awesome block with a step-by-step guide for those tips and most common issue in practice. And even with more importance, we will collect real feedback and pains for each recommended block and other candidates if possile (with help from commmunity). I guess this will help people get to know its limitation before taking too much time to ramp up...

## Things to know before start reading it

You may want to know its limitation before start reading the **[python.note]( https://cosin2008.github.io/python.note/)**...

* We will target on **Python 3** blocks. To most of new developers, ROI will be limited if continue to invest on Python 2 in future...

* And a little bit sorry it is written in **Chinese** and we do not have plan for any other language at least now...

* It is planned to reach feature areas as much as we can, but honestly it need lots of resources and we cannot cover that much yet...
